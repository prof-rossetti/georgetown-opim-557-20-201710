# Class 5 Recap

Hello students,

This week we are dedicating in-class time to work on the [first project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/projects/savings-calculator/project.md), which is due on Friday by 11:59pm.

If you would like help decomposing the project scope into smaller, more manageable parts, feel free to follow these incremental, progressive ["checkpoint" steps](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/projects/savings-calculator/checkpoints.md) which reflect my own development process.

During today's class we demonstrated concepts which will help you implement the project. Namely, we talked about [string formatting](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/notes/visual-basic/datatypes/strings.md#string-formatting), [functions](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/notes/visual-basic/functions.md), and [loops](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/notes/visual-basic/loops.md#do-while--loop-loops). At the end of class I encouraged you to further your ability to use a loop to perform the requisite annual calculations and arrive at the project's final outputs. See if you can do this by the beginning of next class.

At the beginning of next class we will demonstrate techniques for [validating user inputs](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/notes/visual-basic/datatypes.md#checking-a-variables-type) and handling errors.

Hope to see you then!

\- Professor Rossetti
