# Class 8 Recap

Hello students,

Thanks again to those of you who shared your Project 1 solutions at the beginning of class. I appreciated the display of independent learning, attention to user interface, and code attribution.

We spent most of class time walking through how to programmatically write worksheets full of cell values, using an extension of Project 1 as an example. Then we ended class by discussing the [`Array`](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/notes/visual-basic/datatypes/arrays.md) datatype.

I encourage you to take a break from VBA this weekend, but if you can't get enough, feel free to solve this ["Processing CSV Strings" exercise](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master//exercises/processing-csv-strings/exercise.md) I just posted. It challenges you to programmatically convert a CSV string into a spreadsheet of cells (very relevant for the final project).

We will begin next class by walking through a solution to the "Processing CSV Strings" exercise. Then I will introduce the final project to you and help you get started on it.

I look forward to grading your projects this weekend and reading your timesheet feedback!

\- Professor Rossetti
