# Class 4 Recap

Hello students,

Thanks for another fun class this morning.

We spent most of class sharing solutions to the ["All the ActiveX Controls" exercise](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/exercises/all-the-controls/exercise.md). Thanks again to all of you who contributed! I posted a workbook of your solutions and a workbook of my solutions to the `#557` channel on Slack. You'll notice there are a few different ways to solve the challenges, so don't worry if yours looks different.

At the end of class, we introduced the ["Retirement Savings Calculator" project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/projects/savings-calculator/project.md), which is due next Friday at 11:59pm. Your mission over the weekend is to adapt the lessons learned about ActiveX Controls to set up the project's interface. We will continue to work on the project during both of next week's classes.

If you missed class, or if you would like a recap, you'll find the audio-visual Mediasite recording posted to the `#mediasite` channel on Slack. You can expect videos from future classes to be posted there as well.

I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you to submit your timesheet this weekend. And to remind you to start looking for Meetup events to attend within the next few weeks.

Also, to address requests for office hours and extra help, I have scheduled an optional Student Support Session on Saturday at noon in Hariri Conference Room [REDACTED]. Feel free to stop by.

Have a great weekend!

\- Professor Rossetti
