# Class 7 Recap

Hello students,

Thanks for a productive class today. And thanks for your insightful and well-informed questions as we walked through this [example project solution](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/projects/savings-calculator/example-solution/example-solution-calculationless.xlsm), including three different [interfaces](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/projects/savings-calculator/example-solution/interfaces.md) and the underlying [VBA code](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/tree/master/projects/savings-calculator/example-solution/vba-files).

We also talked about [modules](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/notes/visual-basic/modules.md) and [software licensing](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/notes/software/licensing.md) and how you might use the example code in your own projects.

Feel free to use the provided modules in your own projects if necessary, just remember to provide proper attribution. Also feel free to resubmit the first project as many times as you'd like before the Friday 11:59pm deadline. When I evaluate your projects this weekend I will only consider the latest submission.

Next class we will finish our demonstration of how to use loops to perform the project's [calculations](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/projects/savings-calculator/checkpoints/3-calculations/steps.md). Then we will begin to build upon the scope of the first project to provide a practical example of how to write sheets of data.

See you then.

\- Professor Rossetti
