# Class 9 Recap

Hello students,

Today in class we walked through a solution to the ["Processing CSV Strings" Exercise](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/exercises/processing-csv-strings/exercise.md) and then refactored it using loops.

We also introduced the [Final Project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/projects/stock-trading-recommendation-system/project.md) and I demonstrated an example solution.

Then we talked about [Computer Networks](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/notes/computer-networks/notes.md) and [APIs](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/notes/software/apis.md) and learned how to use [the specific API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) we will be using in the final project.

At the end of class, I shared a [VBA way to make HTTP requests](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/notes/visual-basic/references/win-http/notes.md) and challenged you to try to solve the ["Web Requests" Exercise](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/exercises/web-requests/exercise.md) on your own over the break. We will walk through a solution to this exercise at the beginning of next class. Then we will start walking through various [final project checkpoints](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/projects/stock-trading-recommendation-system/checkpoints.md) of interest.

As a reminder, there is no class on Thursday, however please still submit your timesheets sometime this Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.

Have a great Thanksgiving.
