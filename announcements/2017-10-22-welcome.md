# Welcome

Hello students,

I'm looking forward to meeting you all during our first VBA programming class on Tuesday at 11am in [ROOM REDACTED]. Please bring a laptop computer to class, if possible.

In the meantime, please fill out this [pre-semester survey](https://goo.gl/forms/EiefEOjC83lvpo3B2) to help me get a better understanding of your experiences and expectations.

Thanks, and see you soon.

\- Professor Rossetti
