# Class 1 Recap

Hello students,

Thanks for a great first class yesterday. We went over the [Syllabus](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710) and looked at some example files to get a sense of what is possible with VBA-powered MS Excel applications.

To prepare for next class, please make sure to obtain access to MS Excel on a Windows OS computer. And optionally take a few minutes following the [Class 1 powerpoint lecture notes](https://campus.georgetown.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_4454518_1&course_id=_745457_1) to enable the "Developer" menu and record a simple macro. We will spend class time talking about [Information Systems](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/notes/information-systems/overview.md) and MS Excel VBA application architecture.

See you tomorrow.

\- Professor Rossetti
