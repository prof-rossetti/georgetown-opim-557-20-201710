# Class 13 Recap

Hello students,

I have posted final timesheet grades and all Meetups assignment grades to Blackboard. Along with your Meetups grade, you will see a comment which associates your submission with a random unique identifier, which you can use to consult [this results sheet](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/assignments/meetups/results-final.csv) for a detailed score break-down.

Thanks for your valuable and candid [feedback](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/tree/master/exercises/retrospective) during today's Retrospective exercise. These insights help me to continuously improve as a professor.

If you have not yet completed the official [course evaluation](https://eval.georgetown.edu/), please take a moment to do so before the submission window closes tomorrow 12/6 at 11:59pm.

As a reminder, your [final projects](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/projects/stock-trading-recommendation-system/project.md) are due this Friday by 11:59pm. If you need extra help, feel free to attend the optional Student Support Session I have scheduled for this Thursday at 11am in room [REDACTED].

After grading the final projects over the weekend, I will send a final farewell email sometime next week.

Good luck. And stay tuned.

\- Professor Rossetti
