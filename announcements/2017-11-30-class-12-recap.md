# Class 12 Recap

Hello students,

I admired your intense focus during class today. We spent a majority of class [working](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/projects/stock-trading-recommendation-system/checkpoints.md) independently on the [final project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/projects/stock-trading-recommendation-system/project.md). I heard you have an overwhelming amount of assignments from other classes due on 12/5, so I pushed back the final project due date to next Friday 12/8 at 11:59pm. :smiley_cat:

However, please remember to submit your [Meetups assignment](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/assignments/meetups.md) by this Friday at 11:59pm and your [final timesheet](https://goo.gl/forms/9xWp05QximJepQpb2) by this Sunday night.

For our final class next Tuesday, we will be conducting a Retrospective Exercise, which works best when everyone is present, so I hope to see each of you then! I will also provide time at the end of class for you to fill out your official course evaluations.

Have a great weekend.

\- Professor Rossetti
