# Class 2 Recap

Hello students,

Thanks for your participation last class as we discussed topics in [Information Systems](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/notes/information-systems/overview.md) to lay a contextual foundation for the VBA programming work we will be doing this semester.

We finished class by walking through most of the [Introduction to VBA and ActiveX Controls](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/exercises/self-aware-button/exercise.md). This exercise challenges you to create a "self-aware" button that when clicked alerts the user of how many times it has been clicked.

Your mission over the weekend is to use an integer variable to get the button working. If you are stuck or have questions during the process, please send a message to the `#557` channel on Slack.

Next class we will be investigating additional ActiveX Controls like drop-down menus and check-boxes.

Have a great weekend, and see you on Tuesday morning.

\- Professor Rossetti
