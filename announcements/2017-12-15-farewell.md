# Farewell

Hello students,

As I mentioned this week in Slack, I have posted your final project grades to Blackboard. In the comments I have included a unique anonymous project identifier which corresponds to a row in this [detailed project results sheet](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/projects/stock-trading-recommendation-system/results/detailed-results.csv).

I have also posted your final raw scores to Blackboard. In the comments I have included a unique anonymous student identifier which corresponds to a row in this [final grade results sheet](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/results.csv). In this sheet, you will see corresponding letter grade which I have posted to the MyAccess system.

Now that the semester is over, please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikerossetti). Also do not hesitate to reach out via [email](mailto:prof.mj.rossetti@gmail.com) if you need anything in the future.

Good luck with the remainder of your studies, and see you around.

\- Professor Rossetti
