# Class 6 Recap

Hello students,

I have **pushed back the first project's due date by one week** (now due by Friday 11/17 at 11:59pm, although you can still submit by the original due date for up to 15% extra credit). And I've made some serious schedule revisions in your favor, in the interest of maximizing your learning and reducing your stress.

In a constant effort to optimize our use of in-class time, I have observed that in-class time could be better spent sharing solutions than working independently. Accordingly, we will dedicate in-class time next week to **walking-through the project solution step by step**. So even if you're not able to solve the project on your own, you can follow along in-class and review the videos at your own pace to arrive at the solution. This approach is preferred over the extra help sessions I contemplated aloud at the end of class today because perhaps only a few of you would be able to attend the extra help sessions, whereas all of you will have access to in-class time and the corresponding videos.

And since we will not only be extending the first project's due date but also increasing the number of classes spent working on it, I have made some significant project weighting revisions. Specifically, I have **eliminated one of the three projects** and increased the weights of the others accordingly. This ensures you will have enough time to submit quality work product and you will receive the proper amount of credit for the work you are doing.

I know these are significant changes, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask in the `#557` Slack channel. Otherwise, have a great weekend!
