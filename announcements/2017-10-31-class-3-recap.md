# Class 3 Recap

Hello students,

Based on your timesheet feedback, we have started to pick up the pace of instruction. I am thankful for your timely feedback!

In class this morning we went over at least one [example solution](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/exercises/self-aware-button/counting-clicks-solution.md) to the "Self-aware Button" exercise, then we transitioned into a new exercise called ["All the ActiveX Controls"](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/exercises/all-the-controls/exercise.md) which challenges you to make "self-aware" versions of all the popular controls. This work will form the foundation for the rest of the semester, so it is important to take the time now to learn and master these concepts. I would advise you to read the [prerequisite materials](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710/blob/master/exercises/all-the-controls/exercise.md#prerequisites) before starting the exercise, and to reference them as you are working through specific parts of the exercise.

By the end of class, most of you finished the challenges for the `CommandButton` control, and many of you also experimented with other kinds of controls.

Your mission between now and next class is to work through the challenges for at least one or two (or maybe three or four!) more kinds of controls. I am confident in your ability to notice and apply the patterns shared across many of the controls. Work together! Feel free to ask questions and share code in the `#557` channel on Slack.

Next class we will continue working through all the controls, and we will share our control-specific solutions with each other. By the end of class, we will hopefully also introduce the first project (for which I will most likely be pushing back the due date, so stay tuned).

See you on Thursday for another fun, hands-on class!

\- Professor Rossetti
