# Contributor's Guide

This document describes instructions and best practices for contributing to this repository.

Fork the course repository, revise content, then submit.

> NOTE: All contributors must abide by [course policies](/POLICIES.md).

> NOTE: Most files in this repository are written in a syntax called Markdown. For reference, see this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).

## Forking Process

Fork the course repository via the GitHub.com interface to create a copy under the ownership of your own GitHub user. After doing so, you should be able to view your fork online at `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/georgetown-opim-557-20-201710`.

## Content Revision Process

To revise content, click the "pencil" icon to edit a file using an online interface. When done editing a file, "commit" to save the changes. After doing so, you should be able to view your changes reflected online in your own fork.

## Submission Process

After your fork contains the changes you'd like to be included in the course repository, create a Pull Request (PR) using the GitHub online interface. In the PR message, describe what changes you made and why.

The professor should review your PR within a timely manner. If the professor accepts your changes, he will merge them into the course repository's master branch, at which point you should be able to view your changes reflected in the course repository. Else if there are issues with the submission, the instructor should provide further instruction by commenting on the PR, and may close it.

Congratulations! :clap: Thanks! :pray:
