# Timesheets

## Instructions

Each week before Sunday at 11:59pm, please take a few moments to fill-out a [timesheet](https://goo.gl/forms/9xWp05QximJepQpb2). Your responses help the professor monitor your individual progress and identify intervention opportunities to prevent you from falling behind. They also help the professor evaluate instructional methods on an iterative basis.

## Evaluation

Six weekly timesheets are collectively worth 12% towards your final grade.

Each on-time submission counts as 2%. Each submission late by less than 24 hours counts as 1.2%.
