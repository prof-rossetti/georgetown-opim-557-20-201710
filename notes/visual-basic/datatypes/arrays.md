> Array: "A set of sequentially indexed elements having the same intrinsic data type. Each element of an array has a unique identifying index number. Changes made to one element of an array don't affect the other elements." - [glossary of VBA terms](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vba/language-reference-vba/articles/vbe-glossary)

An **array** is a datatype which represents an ordered list of zero or more items of the same datatype.

Individual array elements can be accessed by their position, or "index" value. Array indices are zero-based by default, meaning the index of the first element in an array is 0. However, arrays can be declared using different index values.

#### Declaration

Declare a new array variable, optionally specifying the expected size and datatype of items it will contain:

```vb
Dim Teams(1 To 5) As String ' the array datatype is specified by the parentheses syntax, whereas the string datatype references the datatype of each item in the array.
```

Store items using an index number to indicate the item's unique position in the array:

```vb
Teams(1) = "New York Yankees"
Teams(2) = "New York Mets"
Teams(3) = "Boston Red Sox"
Teams(4) = "New Haven Ravens"
Teams(5) = "Washington Nationals"
```

Access an item by referencing its index number:

```vb
Teams(4) ' --> "New Haven Ravens"
```

Count items in an array by referencing the index of its first item (`LBound()`) and the index of its last item (`UBound()`):

```vb
UBound(MyList) - LBound(MyList) + 1 ' --> 3
```



#### Iteration

Use a `For Each` loop to iterate through each item in the array:

```vba
Dim Team As Variant ' use Variant datatype instead of String datatype to avoid error

For Each Team In Teams
  MsgBox (Team)
Next Team
```
