# Software APIs Overview

A software application's **Application Programming Interface (API)** provides functionality and instructions sufficient to allow other programs to interface with it.

It is not uncommon for a system to also use its own public API to perform its own desired functionality.

Most of todays popular APIs are **web services** which accept HTTP requests at specified URLs and return responses to fulfill those requests. Here are some example APIs and API providers:

 + [New York Times APIs](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs)
 + [Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/)
 + [Twitter APIs](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public)
 + [Facebook Social Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api)
 + [Instagram API](https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/)
 + [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/)
 + [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
 + [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview)
 + [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
 + [Getty Images API](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/)
 + [US Federal Elections Commission API](https://api.open.fec.gov/developers)

Many web services require developers to first register to obtain valid credentials in the form of an **API Key** - a token or secret string of some kind - and subsequently authenticate by providing the key within each API request.
