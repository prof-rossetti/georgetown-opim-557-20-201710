## Description

> This course explores advanced topics in management support systems with a focus on decision theory. The course will present insights into key issues and problems in decision support information systems. The Visual Basic Applications (VBA) programming language within Microsoft Excel will be used as the primary tool to build basic decision support systems. Class deliverables will be systems built with VBA code. - [source](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/faculty-class-detail?courseid=OPIM-557-20&semester=Fall+2017)

## Materials

### Texts

Students are encouraged to consult the official [VBA Language Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vba/vba-language-reference) and [Excel VBA Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vba/vba-excel), as well as other online tutorials and resources.

Students may optionally reference books like [Excel VBA Programming For Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/Excel-Programming-Dummies-John-Walkenbach/dp/1118490371), which has been recommended in previous semesters.

### Computers

Each student should have access to a personal portable computer during class.

The computer should allow use of MS Excel, as well as the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language and ActiveX controls found inside of MS Excel. Students are highly encouraged to use a Windows computer because MS Excel for Mac may not include ActiveX controls.

Any student who doesn't have access to a Windows laptop during class may inquire with the technology center about [loaning a laptop](http://technology.msb.edu/pages/Computing.html#EL) or using virtualization software.

## Evaluation

Student performance will be evaluated by assignments and "deliverable" projects. All assignments and projects are due before 11:59pm on the due date specified, unless otherwise noted.
