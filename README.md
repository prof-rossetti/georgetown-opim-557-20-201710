## Description

> This course explores advanced topics in management support systems with a focus on decision theory. The course will present insights into key issues and problems in decision support information systems. The Visual Basic Applications (VBA) programming language within Microsoft Excel will be used as the primary tool to build basic decision support systems. Class deliverables will be systems built with VBA code. - [source](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/faculty-class-detail?courseid=OPIM-557-20&semester=Fall+2017)
